# Wordiddle

Wordiddle is a solver for the popular game Wordle. Wordiddle is available at https://www.novante.dev/

## How to use

Enter a word on Wordle, submit, and check which color each respective letter has. 

Enter the same word on Wordiddle, and click the squares to set the colors. 
Press 'Diddle'. 

The word list on Wordiddle has now updated to contain all possible words based on your input.
Repeat the process with another word to narrow the list down even further!

### Notes

This project was written as I had nothing to do and suck at Wordle. If you liked it, please leave a comment or something :)
